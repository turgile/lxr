=head1 Lang module

This module contains the API to language processing.
It is responsible for creating the parser and handling the specific
categories editing.

A language parser is an I<object> with associated methods.
I<Lang.pm> creates the base object, to be augmented/overriden by
specific parsers in directory I<Lang>.
The methods described below are generally only dummy declarations
to capture missing specific implementations.

=cut

package LXR::Lang;

use strict;
use LXR::Common;
use IO::Handle;


=head2 C<new ($writeDB, $pathname, $releaseid, @itag)>

Method C<new> creates a new language object.

=over

=item 1

C<$writeDB>

a I<boolean> I<integer> requesting to write language properties
into the tree database,
passed unaltered to the specific parser initialisation method
(set to 1 only by I<genxref>)

=item 2

C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the name of the file to parse

=item 3

C<$releaseid>

a I<string> containing the release (version) of the file to parse

B<Note:>

=over

=item

I<Considering all call locations,
this argument is not really necessary and we could as well
use the global variable.>

=back

=item 4

C<@itag>

an I<array> of 3 elements used to generate an C<E<lt> A E<gt>> link
for the identifiers found in the file (just insert the identifier name
between the array elements)

=back

Creation of a specific parser is attempted first based on the file name
and information from configuration parameter C<'filetype'>.
If the file type is unknown,
the first line of the file is read to tentatively extract a I<shebang>
processed through configuration parameter C<'interpreters'>.
In case there is no I<shebang>,
an emacs-style C<mode:> is looked for.

If all fail, C<undef> is returned.

The LXR language name and argument C<@itag> are recorded in
the created parser which is then returned.

=head2 C<parseable ($pathname, $releaseid)>

Function C<parseable> returns 1 if the designated file can be parsed
some way or other.

=over

=item 1

C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the name of the file to parse

=item 2

C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

This a streamlined version of method C<new> where the filename argument
is checked against the patterns from I<filetype.conf>
or the first line of the file against the I<interpreters> list.

=head2 C<multilinetwist ($frag, $css)>

Internal function C<multilinetwist> marks the fragment with a CSS class.

=over

=item 1

C<$frag>

a I<string> to mark

=item 2

C<$css>

a I<string> containing the CSS class

=back

The fragment is surrounded with C<E<lt> SPAN E<gt>> and C<E<lt> /SPAN E<gt>>
tags. Special care is taken to repeat these tags at end of lines, so
that the fragment can be correctly displayed on several lines without
disturbing other highlighting (such as line numbers or difference marks).

=head2 C<processstring ($frag)>

Method C<processstring> marks the fragment as a string.

=head2 C<processinclude ($frag, $dir)>

Method C<processinclude> is invoked to process an I<include> directive.

=over

=item 1

C<$frag>

a I<string> containing the directive

=item 2

C<$dir>

an optional I<string> containing a preferred directory for the include'd file

=back

Usually, the link to the include'd file is built with C<'incref'>.
Consequently, the directories in C<'incprefix'> are also searched.

=cut

sub processinclude {
	my ($self, $frag, $dir) = @_;
	warn  __PACKAGE__."::processinclude not implemented. Parameters @_";

i.e. the result of an invocation of C<incref> or C<incdirref>.

=item 2

C<$file>

dialect (without language-specific separator replacement),

=item 3

C<$path>

a I<string> containing the target file name as an OS file name
(path separator is /),

=item 5

C<$dir>

a I<string> containing the last directory argument for C<incdirref>.

=back

This function is a utility function reserved for the language parsers.

=cut

sub _linkincludedirs {
	my ($self, $link, $file, $sep, $path, $dir) = @_;
	my ($sp, $l, $r);	# various separator positions

=head2 C<_incfindfile ($filewanted, $file, @paths)>

Function C<_incfindfile> returns the "full" path corresponding to argument
C<$file>.

=over

=item 1

C<$filewanted>

a I<flag> indicating if a directory (0) or file (1) is desired

=item 2

C<$file>

a I<string> containing a file name to resolve

=item 3

C<@paths>

an I<array> containing a list of directories to search

=back

The list of directories from configuration parameter C<'incprefix'> is
appended to C<@paths>. Every directory from this array is then preprended
to the file name . The resulting string is transformed by the mapping
rules of configuration parameter C<'maps'> (See I<Config.pm> sub C<mappath>).

If there is a match in the file database (file or directory according
to the first argument), the "physical" path is returned.
Otherwise, an C<undef> is returned to signal an unknown file.

I<This is a "private" or "internal" C<sub> for include path resolution only.>

=cut

sub _incfindfile {
	my ($filewanted, $file, @paths) = @_;
	my $path;

	# The following line could be faster interpreted as
	# 	push(@paths, @{$config->{'incprefix'}});
	# but this would forbid variable expansion.
	# Is this feature really needed for include path?
	push(@paths, $config->incprefix);

	foreach my $dir (@paths) {
		$dir =~ s!/+$!!;	# Remove trailing slashes
		$path = $config->mappath($dir . '/' . $file);

		} else {
			return $path if $files->isdir($path, $releaseid);
		}
	}

	return undef;
}


=head2 C<incdirref ($name, $css, $file, @paths)>

Function C<incdirref> returns an C<E<lt> A E<gt>> link to a directory
of an C<include>d file or the directory name if it is unknown.

=over

=item 1

C<$name>

a I<string> for the user-visible part of the link,
usually the directory name

=item 2

C<$css>

a I<string> containing the CSS class for the link

=item 3

C<$file>

a I<string> containing the HTML path to the directory

=item 4

C<@paths>

an I<array> containing a list of base directories to search

=back

I<This function is supposed to be called AFTER sub C<incref> on every
subpath of the include'd file, removing successively the tail directory.
It thus allows to compose a path where each directory is separately
clickable.>

If the include'd directory does not exist (as determined by sub C<incfindfile>),
the function returns the directory name. This acts as a "no-op" in the
HTML sequence representing the full path of the include'd file.

If the directory exists, the function returns the C<E<lt> A E<gt>> link
as computed by sub C<fileref> for the directory.

=cut

sub incdirref {
	my ($name, $css, $file, @paths) = @_;
	my $path;
