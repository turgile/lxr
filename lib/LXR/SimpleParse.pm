=head1 SimpleParse module

This module is the elementary parser in charge of splitting the
source file into homogeneous regions (i.e. fragments defined by
C<'spec'>s in I<generic.conf>).

=cut

package LXR::SimpleParse;

use strict;
use integer;

require Exporter;

our @ISA    = qw(Exporter);
our @EXPORT = qw(
	&doparse
	&untabify
	&init
	&nextfrag
	$dountab
);

# Global module variables

my $fileh;		# File handle
my @frags;		# Fragments in queue
my $next;		# Current fragment
my @bodyid;		# Array of body type ids
my @open;		# Fragment opening delimiters
my @term;		# Fragment closing delimiters
my @stay;		# Fragment maintaining current context
my $split;		# Fragmentation regexp
my $open;		# Fragment opening regexp
my $continue;	# Fragment maintaining current context for "no category"
my $tabwidth;   # Tab width
our $dountab;	# Untabify flag (in nextfrag)


=head2 C<init ($fileh, $tabhint, @blksep)>

C<init> initializes the global variables
and builds the detection regexps.

=over

=item 1

C<$fileh>

a I<filehandle> for the source file

=item 2

C<$tabhint>

hint for the tab width (defaults to 8 if not defined)

Actual value can be given in an emacs-style comment as the first
line of the file.

=item 3

C<@blksep>

an I<array> of references to I<hashes> defining the different
categories for this languages (see I<generic.conf>)

=back

=cut

sub init {
	my @blksep;

	$tabwidth = $tabhint // 8;

# Consider every specification in the order given
	foreach my $s (@blksep) {
		#	$k is category name (e.g; comment, string, ...)
		my $k = (keys(%$s))[0];
		if ($k eq 'atom') {		# special case for uncategorised fragments
			$continue = $$s{$k};
		} else {
			#	Value is itself a reference to an array
			my $v = $$s{$k};
			push (@bodyid, $k);			# Category name
			push (@open, $$v[0]);		# Open delimiter
			push (@term, $$v[1]);	# Closing delimiter
			push (@stay, $$v[2]);	# Locking pattern
		}
	}

	# Create the regexps to find any opening delimiter
	foreach (@open) {
		$open  .= "($_)|";
		$split .= "$_|";
	}
	chop($open);	# Remove the last (extraneous) bar
	$open = '^[\xFF\n]*(?:'.$open.')$';	# Set the anchors
	chop($split);	# Remove the last (extraneous) bar
}


=head2 C<untabify ($line, $tab)>

C<untabify> replaces TAB characters by spaces.

=over

=item 1

C<$line>

I<string> to untabify

=item 2

C<$tab>

number of spaces for a TAB (defaults to 8 if not defined)

=back

Returns the line after replacement.

Note that this sub is presently only used by sub C<markupfile>
when no specific parser definition could be found.
No attempt is made to interpret an emacs-style tab specification.
Consequently, tab width can be erroneous.

=cut

sub untabify {
	my $t = $_[1] || 8;

	$_[0] =~ s/^(\t+)/(' ' x ($t * length($1)))/geo;	# Optimize for common case.
	$_[0] =~ s/([^\t]*)\t/$1.(' ' x ($t - (length($1) % $t)))/geo;
	return ($_[0]);
}


=head2 C<nextfrag ()>

C<nextfrag> returns the next categorized region of the source file.

Returned value is a list: C<($btype, $frag)>.

=over

=item 1

C<$btype>

a I<string> giving the category name

=item 2

C<$frag>

a I<string> containing the region

Note that the "region" may span several lines.

=back

C<nextfrag> implements the LXR parser. It is critical for global
performance. Unfortunately, two factors put a heavy penalty on it:

1- Perl is an interpreted language,

2- parsing with regexp is not as efficient as a finite state 
automaton (FSA).

=over

=item

I<Speed is acceptable when displaying a file (since time here is
dominated by HTML editing).>

=item

I<Raw speed can be seen during I<genxref> where the full tree is
parsed. It could be worth to replace the parser by a compiled
deterministic FSA version.>

#	If the specification defines a locking pattern (in $stay),

#	pattern matching, not LR parsing.
#	1-	See if there is a terminator (either the closing delimiter
#		if defined or any opening delimiter) in the line.
#		If none, the whole line is made of a single category.
#		Otherwise, note its position.
#	2-	Loop on the presence of a "stay" atom in the line.
#		If none, leave the loop.
#	3-	If the "stay" atom is located after (i.e. at the right of)
#		the closing delimiter, leave the loop.
#	4-	The part up to and including the "stay" atom is shifted
#		into the candidate fragment and the position of the
#		terminator is updated for the next iteration of the
#		inner loop.
#	The process is repeated until there is no more "stay" atoms
#	in the correct range.
