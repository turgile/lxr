=head1 Files module

This module defines the abstract access methods to the files of the
source-tree, independent of the repository format.

=head2 C<new ($srcroot, $params)>

C<new> is Files object constructor.
It dispatches to the specific constructor based on its first argument.

=over

=item 1 C<$srcroot>

a I<string> containing the repository type (as optional prefix:)
and its location in the file system

=item 1 C<$params>

an optional I<hash> from lxr.conf used to pass extra information
to the real constructor

=back

=cut

sub new {
	my ( $self, $srcroot, $params ) = @_;
	my $files;

	if ( $srcroot =~ /^CVS:(.*)/i ) {
		require LXR::Files::CVS;
		$srcroot = $1;
		$files   = LXR::Files::CVS->new($srcroot);
	}
	elsif ( $srcroot =~ /^git:(.*)/i ) {

=head2 C<getdir ($pathname, $releaseid)>

C<getdir> returns a directory content in an array.

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path relative to C<'sourceroot'>

=item 1 C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

=back

Function result is C<undef> if directory does not exist in this
version.

=cut

sub getdir {
  my ($self, $pathname, $releaseid) = @_;
  my @dircontents;
	warn  __PACKAGE__."::getdir not implemented. Parameters @_";
	return @dircontents;
}

=head2 C<getfile ($pathname, $releaseid)>

C<getfile> returns a file content in a string.

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path relative to C<'sourceroot'>

=item 1 C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

=back

Function result is C<undef> if file does not exist in this version.

=cut

# NOTE: This sub is only used by genxref to give a copy of the
#	file to swish-e. Is it really useful?
# -	It is also used by some sub-classes to compute file size
#	when there is no other means to determine it.

sub getfile {
	my ($self, $filename, $releaseid) = @_;

	my $fileh = $self->getfilehandle($filename, $releaseid);
	return undef unless $fileh;
	my $content = join('', $fileh->getlines);
	close ($fileh);
	return $content;
}

=head2 C<getannotations ($pathname, $releaseid)>

C<getannotations> returns the annotations for the designated file.

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path relative to C<'sourceroot'>

=item 1 C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

=back

An I<annotation> is whatever auxiliary line information kept in
the repository. There is none in plain files. It is the revision
number the line was entered in CVS. It is the release-id in GIT.

Function result is an empty list if there is no annotation or
annotation retrieval is barred by lxr.conf.

=cut

sub getannotations {
	my ($self, $filename, $releaseid) = @_;
	warn  __PACKAGE__."::getannotations not implemented. Parameters @_";
	my @annotations;
	return @annotations;
}

=head2 C<getauthor ($pathname, $annotation)>

C<getauthor> returns the author of the designated revision.

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path relative to C<'sourceroot'>

=item 1 C<$annotation>

the I<annotation> (see sub C<getannotations>) whose author is
looked for

B<Caveat:>

=over

=item

Since VCSs have different ways of identifying file versions,
C<$releaseid> cannot be used.
A prior call to C<getannotations> is needed to associate first
the file and its version.
Next the annotation for the current line is used to get the author.

=back

=back

=cut

sub getauthor {
	my ($self, $filename, $annotation) = @_;
	warn  __PACKAGE__."::getauthor not implemented. Parameters @_";
	my $author;
	return $author;
}

=head2 C<filerev ($pathname, $releaseid)>

C<filerev> returns the latest revision for the file.

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path relative to C<'sourceroot'>

=item 1 C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

=back

For repositories that do not manage versions (i.e. plain files),
return something making sense, but it does not need to be real.

=cut

sub filerev {
	my ($self, $filename, $releaseid) = @_;
	warn  __PACKAGE__."::filerev not implemented. Parameters @_";
	my $filerev;
	return $filerev;
}

=head2 C<getfilehandle ($pathname, $releaseid)>

C<getfilehandle> returns a handle to the designated file
for further access to the content.

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path relative to C<'sourceroot'>

=item 1 C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

=back

Returning a file handle may require specific operations with
the repository (check out, file extraction, &hellip;).

=cut

sub getfilehandle {
	my ($self, $filename, $releaseid) = @_;
	warn  __PACKAGE__."::getfilehandle not implemented. Parameters @_";
	my $fh;
	return $fh;
}

=head2 C<getfilesize ($pathname, $releaseid)>

C<getfilesize> returns the file size in bytes.

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path relative to C<'sourceroot'>

=item 1 C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

=back

For some repositories, this may require extracting the file.

=cut

sub getfilesize {
	my ($self, $filename, $releaseid) = @_;
	warn  __PACKAGE__."::getfilesize not implemented. Parameters @_";
	my $filesize;
	return $filesize;
}

=head2 C<getfiletime ($pathname, $releaseid)>

C<getfiletime> returns the file last modification time.

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path relative to C<'sourceroot'>

=item 1 C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

=back

For some repositories, this may require extracting the file.

=cut

sub getfiletime {
	my ($self, $filename, $releaseid) = @_;
	warn  __PACKAGE__."::getfiletime not implemented. Parameters @_";
	my $modificationTimeInSecondsSinceEpoch;
	return $modificationTimeInSecondsSinceEpoch;
}

=head2 C<isdir ($pathname, $releaseid)>

C<isdir> returns "true" if the designated path exists and
is a directory.

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path relative to C<'sourceroot'>

=item 1 C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

=back

Since testing for a directory is rather time-consuming,
arrange to "canonise" paths at the end of httpinit so that
directories always end with C</>. Test will done only once,
eventually adding C</> suffix.
Afterwards, all is needed is test for the trailing slash.

This sub is used when the existence must be confirmed, such as
when processing an include link since it is independent from
the currently displayed file.

=cut

sub isdir {
	my ($self, $pathname, $releaseid) = @_;
	warn  __PACKAGE__."::isdir not implemented. Parameters: @_";
	my $boolean;
	return $boolean;
}

=head2 C<isfile ($pathname, $releaseid)>

C<isfile> returns "true" if the designated path exists and
is a file.

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path relative to C<'sourceroot'>

=item 1 C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

=back

This sub is used when the existence must be confirmed, such as
when processing an include link since it is independent from
the currently displayed file.

B<Note:>

=over

=item

I<< When the file is subsequently accessed, it is much simpler and
efficient to use C<getfilehandle>, since a handle will be
required anyway.>

=back

=cut

sub isfile {
	my ($self, $pathname, $releaseid) = @_;
	warn  __PACKAGE__."::isfile not implemented. Parameters: @_";
	my $boolean;
	return $boolean;
}

=head2 C<realfilename ($pathname, $releaseid)>

C<realfilename> returns a real filename with the same
content as the designated path (or undef).

=over

=item 1 C<$pathname>

a I<string> containing the path relative to C<'sourceroot'>

=item 1 C<$releaseid>

the release (or version) in which C<$pathname> is expected to
be found

=back

Extract content of the path from repository and stuf it into a
temporary file whose name is returned.

B<Note:>

=over

=item

Override this method if repository is made of plain files
which can be accessed without the copy operation.

=back

=cut

sub realfilename {
	my ($self, $filename, $releaseid) = @_;
	my ($tmp, $fileh);

	$fileh = $self->getfilehandle ($filename, $releaseid);
	return undef unless defined($fileh);

	$tmp = $config->tmpdir
			. '/lxrtmp.'
			. time
			. '.' . $$
			. '.' . &LXR::Common::tmpcounter;
	open (TMP, "> $tmp") || return undef;
	print (TMP <$fileh>);
	close ($fileh);
	close (TMP);

	return $tmp;
}

=head2 C<releaserealfilename ($filename)>

C<releaserealfilename> erases the file created by C<realfilename>.

=over

=item 1 C<$filename>

a I<string> containing the filename

=back

Although some care is exercised to check C<$filename> was created
by C<realfilename>, this test is not fool-proof.
Use this method B<ONLY> against files returned by C<realfilename>.

B<Caveat:>

=over

=item

If you have overridden C<realfilename>, be sure to override also
this method to revert accurately what you have done, otherwise
you risk destroying a valid source-tree file.

=back

=cut

sub releaserealfilename {
	my ($self, $filename) = @_;

	my $td = $config->{'tmpdir'};
	if ($filename =~ m!^$td/lxrtmp\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+$!) {
		unlink($filename);
	}
}
