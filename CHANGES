This file draws your attention on changes made for

        ==========================
        LXR 0.9.9  -->  LXR 0.9.10
        ==========================

This version is mainly a bug fix release.

Change in generic parser for string was too specific and could result in loss of synchronisation under certain circumstances (i.e. string interpreted as code and code considered as string). Thanks to users feed-back, C, C++, Perl and Python are validated.

It contains partial implementation of features announced for 0.10. DO NOT RELY on them, they are unstable.

        LXR 0.9.8  -->  LXR 0.9.9
        =========================

which could impact your existing trees.

If they result in an incompatibility, you must reindex your tree.

lxr.conf
--------
File restructured for more logical reading		=> no impact

Parameter 'graphicfile'
  More file extensions considered "graphic"		=> no impact on indexing
	May prevent indexing if extensions used for something non graphic;
	in that case, modify parameter
  Parameter now used both to tag file as graphic in directory listing
  and attempting to display it (consistency)	=> no impact on indexing
  Pattern simplified: match at end of file name now implicit
	May not give you what you expect if you used untypical pattern
	testing something in the middle of the file name.
	In that case, report as a bug or a feature request
	for general test on any part of the filename.

Parameter 'filetype'
  Default tab width changed for some languages	=> no impact on indexing
	Changes the appearance of source listing

New parameters 'treeextract' and 'encoding'		=> no impact on indexing

lxr.css and templates
---------------------
Many more class'es to give more control on appearance	=> no impact on indexing

New template html-fatal.html (error recovery)	=> no impact on indexing

Language parsing
----------------
Parser in SimpleParse.pm improved so as not to lose context
in languages with escape rules (such as C/C++ and Perl). As a
consequence captures more identifiers

Impact of change not validated outside C, C++ and Perl. Please
report any abnormal parsing, particularly regarding "escape"
sequences (think of \" in C-strings). Abnormal parsing means not
classifying correctly a fragment of file as comment, string, include
or code, or not giving it the correct extent, not missing an identifier.

(CAUTION: identifier recognition is first dependent on ctags
  capability during genxref step; thus a missed identifier
  may be the result of it unknown to the database and the
  parser cannot then be blamed.)

generic.conf
------------
File restructured								=> no impact on indexing

Syntax changed for language specification
  'langid' changed (but C and C++)				=> reindex if other languages
  new 'identdef' to define an identifier		=> no impact on indexing
	Gives you more control on what is an identifier and reserved keyword
  'spec' syntax changed
	May capture more identifiers
	If you made modifications, read manual before merging your
	changes; in particular, 'atom' rule may no longer be needed.
												=> reindex if deemed worth

find script
-----------
Removed find script and html-find.html template as they were no longer
integrated inside LXR and replaced by search.

No impact unless you customised find and want to merge your changes in
search and associated templates.
