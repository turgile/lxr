	* find, search, templates/lxr.conf: Change dbdir config variable to
	glimpsedir

2002-01-23 15:52  mbox

	* INSTALL, genxref, search, templates/lxr.conf: Add ability to use
	swish-e as a free-text search engine, rather than Glimpse.  Swish-e
	is fully free software, unlike Glimpse.
	
	Patch from Arne.

2002-01-23 15:48  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Index/Postgres.pm: Make sure all sql statements are
	undef'ed to prevent warnings from Pg.pm

2002-01-23 15:14  mbox

	* CREDITS.txt, INSTALL: Updated INSTALL document from Guido Sohne.

2002-01-23 14:59  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Lang.pm, templates/lxr.conf: Add mapping from interpreter
	names to languages.  If the file extension does not select a
	language, then the first line of the file is checked for a #! If
	one is found, then the interpreter name is matched against the
	'interpreters' map in lxr.conf, and the relevant language module
	loaded.

2002-01-23 08:16  mbox

	* templates/lxr.conf: Fix bug #506845: Missing variable in lxr.conf
	
	Added $dbdir to the lxr.conf template.

2002-01-23 08:12  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Lang.pm: Fix bug 506627: Excessive memory usage.  Rather
	than read the whole file into memory to determine if it is a
	script, get a filehandle to it and retrieve the first line.  This
	may still mean the whole file ends up in memory "under the hood",
	depending on the implementation of the individual backends, but
	with Plain.pm it doesn't.

2001-11-28 12:59  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Lang/Generic.pm: Apply speedup patch from Arne.
	
	Makes Generic.pm only read the config file once, and then share the
	info between instances.

2001-11-28 12:59  mbox

	* initdb-postgres, lib/LXR/Index/Postgres.pm: Applied Postgres
	fixes from Kristoffer Gleditsch <toffer@ping.uio.no>

2001-11-20 15:34  mbox

	* ident: Remove pre-CSS & template code

2001-11-18 03:31  mbox

	* ident, initdb-mysql, initdb-postgres, lib/LXR/Common.pm,
	lib/LXR/Index/Mysql.pm, lib/LXR/Index/Postgres.pm,
	lib/LXR/Lang/Generic.pm, lib/LXR/Lang/generic.conf,
	templates/html-ident.html, templates/lxr.conf: Fix bug 476695 -
	Java interfaces display as docs.  Changes the type field in the
	indexes table to be a (langid, typeid) tuple, and adds another
	table to look up the (langid, typeid) -> string mapping.  This
	means that each language module can manage its own string table and
	the right identifier type can easily be displayed.
	
	This also means that each identifier is tagged with the language it
	occurs in, which could be used for filtering displayed results when
	browsing.  This has not been implemented.
	
	This change is database incompatible - you will need to drop and
	recreate the lxr database.  MySQL has been tested, Postgres has not
	though the changes have been made.
	
	Also add some limited support for Makefile in generic.conf.

2001-11-17 04:00  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Lang/Generic.pm: Fix bug with referencing files due to
	omitting a parameter to SimpleParse::init

2001-11-17 03:48  mbox

	* templates/html-head.html: Remove reference to "Cross referencing
	Linux" and replaced with more generic header line.  Still to do:
	Create a LXR logo and replace the pengmini.gif with it

2001-11-17 03:06  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Common.pm: Fix bug with configurable tabwidth and files
	that have no language associated with them.
	
	Remove the stat-ing of all the included modules when generating a
	Last-Modified header.  This should speed up HTML generation since
	there are a lot of modules and they change very rarely.

2001-11-14 15:41  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Index/Mysql.pm: Make Mysql insert statements less fragile

2001-11-14 15:03  mbox

	* lib/LXR/: Common.pm, Lang.pm, SimpleParse.pm, Lang/Generic.pm,
	Lang/generic.conf: Make tabwidth to use for display configurable on
	a per-language basis from the lxr.conf file.  As before, this is
	still overridden by an emacs "tab-width" line.

	templates/lxr.conf: Apply patch 458027 from Pavel Hlavnicka
	
	Adds stylesheet (CSS) support to ident, source and diff.
	
	Output style is now controllable from via the lxr.css stylesheet
	(example provided in templates).  Ident output now generated via a
	template rather than hard coded.
	
	Minor additional fixes by me result in the output of ident & source
	both validating as HTML 4.01 Transitional.

	* initdb-mysql, initdb-postgres: Dramatically speed up (>50 times)
	the speed of incremental indexing by creating an index to allow the
	fileid to be looked up fast from the filename.
	
	Ideally this index would include the revision as well, but this is
	not possible in MySQL because of limits (500 chars) on the index
	key.
	
	Tested on MySQL, but not on postgres.
	
	Fixes bug 465131

2001-08-04 19:09  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Index/Mysql.pm: Move the database handle and the sql
	statements into member variables rather than as global (package)

	* Local.pm, source: Remove redundant use declaration

	* lxr.conf.template: Added configuration for which files use which
	Lang module.  Set to use Generic.pm for all languages, replacing
	C.pm, Java.pm and Perl.pm.  This fixes the C++ problems and the
	Java browsing now works.  Added configuration for what files are
	considered an image.

2001-08-04 17:45  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Lang.pm: Determination of the language for a particular
	file is now controlled by the lxr.conf file.  Added processinclude
	to the class so that all languages have include processing.

	an image or not to a be configurable regexp rather than hardcoding.

2001-08-04 17:39  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Lang/: Generic.pm, generic.conf: Update of the language
	info file.  Make referencefile() work - although this is currently
	hardcoded as to what it assumes might be an identifier, rather than
	on a per-language basis.  Currently the identifier must start with
	a letter and then be alphanumeric + _ No longer hyperlink a
	reserved word in the current language, since with multi-language
	projects a reserved word from one language can be a valid symbol in
	another.

2001-08-04 16:22  mbox

	* genxref: Fix the allversions problem.  For Plain.pm, the use of
	$files->getdir() in the recursive loop wasn't working, since at
	that $files->point no version was specified.
	
	The fix is to iterate over the versions at the top level, using the
	range variable from the config file to specify which versions are
	to be indexed if the --allversions option (or none) is given. 
	Because the value of "range" can be a closure, this should allow
	the CVS users to dynamically discover the set of versions in a
	repository.

2001-08-02 11:45  pok

	* lib/LXR/Files/CVS.pm: I hate global variables.  %cvs was not
	reset when a new file was parsed, leaving old data in the hash.

2001-08-01 10:59  pok

	* genxref: Changed the behaviour of genxref back to prevoius
	behaviour, where each file is queried for its versions.

2001-08-01 08:08  pok

	* lib/LXR/Files/CVS.pm: typo in sub filerev.  caused wrong versions

	language support.  More things are now handled in a language
	dependant way, configured from generic.conf.

2001-06-17 08:35  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Lang/: Generic.pm, generic.conf: Initial versions of
	generic language support based on ectags.  The Generic.pm module
	should be able to cope with any language that ectags can cope with
	with only small alterations to the generic.conf file.
	
	This module is not yet hooked up in Lang.pm, so it's not used by
	genxref.

2001-05-31 14:45  mbox

	* INSTALL, lib/LXR/Common.pm, lib/LXR/Index.pm,
	lib/LXR/Index/Mysql.pm: Removes the popup of new browsing windows
	when selecting identifiers/searches.  Updates for the INSTALL
	guide.	Make an explicit error if we can't find the right DB,
	rather than trying to fall back to DBM and ending up with an
	obscure message.  Added more finish() statements to MySQL.pm in an
	attempt to remove the warning about closing handle before
	disconnect - not yet cured.
