/*
 *	SQL template for user management of unique record numbers
 *	(C) 2013-2013 A. Littoz
 *
 *	This template is intended to be included in other SQL templates
 *	and further customised by Perl script initdb-config.pl.
 *	It creates the tables for replacement of built-in auto increment
 *	fields as experiments showed a substantial performance boost.
 *	Explanation:
 *		LXR writes into the database only at genxref time and
 *		does this with massive insertion in a short period and
 *		nobody else than genxref ever writes to the DB (*).
 *		Consequently, playing with COMMIT frequency results in
 *		fewer I/O and higher processing speed.
 *	(*) If somebody fancies to try to write while genxref is active,
 *		this assertion is broken and the DB will become an unusable
 *		mess.
 *
 *	This strategy is incompatible with multi-threading if it is
 *	ever reconsidered.
 *
 *	The specific DB managers in Index/ must be adapted to the
 *	presence of these extra tables.
