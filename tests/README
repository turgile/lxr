To run these tests:

- Make sure Test::Unit is installed
- Execute TestRunner.pl AllTests

Note: If you wish to run the Bitkeeper tests you will need to:
- Grab the lxr-tools module from CVS to the same top-level as the lxr tree
(so you have /mydir/lxr and /mydir/lxr-tools)
- untar the bk-test-repository.tgz file in lxr-tools/test-data
- uncomment the BKTest line in AllTests.pm
